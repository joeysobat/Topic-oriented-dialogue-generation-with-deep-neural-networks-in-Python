# Topic-oriented-dialogue-generation-with-deep-neural-networks-in-Python

Dialogue systems are some of the most wide-spread models in terms of human-machine interaction and have proven to be quite useful in a variety of environments and social interactions with real people. It is also a very complex field, where many components take part in intricate and resource-intensive tasks and can cover several topics. Spoken dialogue systems, for instance, need a significant amount of human resources and time to be properly developed. Many of these systems give answers that may be considered generic or incoherent. This happens due to the lack of diversity and the model not being able to track dialogues with people in long periods of time. To improve the discourse of the system, it is required to try to solve these issues and build dialogue systems with personality and human character. In this project, we investigated the use of deep neural network paradigms for conversational models. We also had to take into consideration observing persona-based models for more diverse dialogue generation. After studying several architectures, we implemented two models and analyzed their results, in hopes of achieving personal models with diverse responses
