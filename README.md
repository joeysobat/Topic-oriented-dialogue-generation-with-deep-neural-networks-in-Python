# Topic-oriented-dialogue-generation-with-deep-neural-networks-in-Python

Dialogue systems are some of the most wide-spread models in terms of human-machineinteraction and have proven to be quite useful in a variety of environments and socialinteractions with real people. It is also a very complex field, where many componentstake part in intricate and resource-intensive tasks and can cover several topics. Spokendialogue systems, for instance, need a significant amount of human resources and time tobe properly developed.Many of these systems give answers that may be considered generic or incoherent. Thishappens due to the lack of diversity and the model not being able to track dialogues withpeople in long periods of time. To improve the discourse of the system, it is required to tryto solve these issues and build dialogue systems with personality and human character.In this project, we investigated the use of deep neural network paradigms for conversa-tional models. We also had to take into consideration observing persona-based models formore diverse dialogue generation. After studying several architectures, we implementedtwo models and analyzed their results, in hopes of achieving personal models with diverseresponses
